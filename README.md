## üíª Compatibility

This tool works on all devices, including Windows with some exceptions. You will not be able to get download & upload speeds on Windows at the moment.

This was initially designed to be run on Raspberry Pis, however, it will work on all devices as long as you have NodeJS installed.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system (and preferrably [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), but npm works just as well!). If you don't have NodeJS installed, you can follow the script below:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm install node
nvm use node
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

This will install nvm, NodeJS, npm, yarn & the required dependencies. If you already have NodeJS installed, you can just install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm i # Using npm

yarn # Using yarn
```
Then, you can query your system's info using:

```bash
yarn query
```

### üí† Modes

There are two modes you can run it in. The first mode is the simplest. It basically tells you information about your device when you query it. To run this mode, you just need to enter:

```bash
yarn query
```

The second mode is daemon mode. This will run a Discord webhook & Telegram bot in the background for you to get updates from. It will run you through the basic setup process on first run. To activate it, just type:

```bash
yarn daemon:start
```

The daemon process is handled by [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2). You can find more information on it's GitHub page. To stop the process, just type:

```bash
yarn daemon:stop
```

The default frequency the daemon pings Discord is `10 minutes` or `60000 milliseconds`. You can modify this by passing in the `--frequency` command line argument when starting the daemon as seen in the example below:

```bash
yarn daemon:start --frequency=120000
```

### üîë Setting Up Tokens

Discord webhooks & Telegram bot tokens are immediately set up on first run.

If you wish to edit your Discord webhook / Telegram bot token, you can run

```bash
yarn setup
```
