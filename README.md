# Raspberry Pi NodeJS Monitor

A tool to monitor information about your Raspberry Pi & can be configured to update its status via Discord/Telegram

## Getting Started

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system (and preferrably [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), but npm works just as well!). If you don't have NodeJS installed, you can follow the script below:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm install node
nvm use node
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

This will install nvm, NodeJS, npm, yarn & the required dependencies. Then, you can query your system's info using:

```bash
node services/query.sh
```

### Modes

There are two modes you can run it in. The first mode is the simplest. It basically tells you information about your device when you query it. To run this mode, you just need to enter:

```bash
node services/query.js
```

The second mode is daemon mode. This will run a Discord webhook & Telegram bot in the background for you to get updates from. It will run you through the basic setup process on first run. To activate it, just type:

```bash
npx pm2 start services/daemon.js
```

The daemon process is handled by [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2). You can find more information on it's GitHub page. To stop the process, just type:

```bash
npx pm2 stop daemon
```

TODO:

- [] Check if bot is correct
